Having trouble finding those folder icons on your Mac? If you're just relying on their names, this blog is here to help! Learn how to customize your folders using the website [myicons.tech](https://myicons.tech/).

Alright, let's kick things off by creating a logo that we'll use as the folder icon. If you already have one, feel free to skip the icon creation part and jump straight to where I'll guide you on applying the folder icon. Let's begin by crafting our folder icon.

### Steps to create a custom folder icon

> Let's craft a folder icon without losing original essence of the folder.

1. Open the website [myicons.tech](https://myicons.tech/).
2. Navigate to the [All Icons](https://myicons.tech/icons) page and search for your desired icon. If found, proceed to the steps on changing the folder icon. If not, or if you're unsatisfied, create a custom one.
3. Visit [Create Custom Icon](https://myicons.tech/create), choose a base icon (dark or your preference).
4. After selecting the base icon, search for the PNG image of the icon you want for your folder. For instance, drag and drop the OBS icon, then resize and center it.
5. Add the icon, click export on the left, provide a name (e.g., OBS), select the operating system (e.g., macOS), and if not sharing publicly, uncheck the last box. Click render.
6. After a few seconds, the icon will be rendered, and you'll be redirected to the icon's page. Your custom icon is ready!

### Steps for applying it as a folder icon

1. Create a new folder or use an existing one.
2. After creating the folder, press `cmd+i` to open its details.
3. Drag and drop the icon you made from the website onto the small icon preview on the left side of the folder details window.
4. Your icon is now set for the folder.
5. To undo, simply select the icon, open folder details, and press `cmd+z`.
